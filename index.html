              <h3>An Overview of Epicodus</h3>
              <p>Epicodus offers full-time courses in languages such as C#, PHP, Javascript, .NET, Ruby, Rails, React, and more. Every track starts with Introduction to Programming, and includes an advanced JavaScript course, as well as two language-specific courses — four five-week sessions in total. In addition, students complete two weeks of job and internship prep and finish their studies with a five-week internship.</p>
              <p>Most class days, you'll practice pair programming: two people sharing one computer, taking turns who uses the keyboard and mouse. By working together, you catch each other's mistakes and teach each other new skills. Pairing is increasingly used by tech companies and we've found that pair programming helps you learn programming concepts faster, too.</p>

              <h3>CSS &amp; Design</h3>
              <p>CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, fonts, and other stylistic choices. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, and printers. HTML — used for building the structure of the page — and CSS — used for the visual layout — are the two basic languages involved in the building of web pages and web applications.</p>
              <p>Web design is a process of conceptualizing, planning, and building a collection of electronic files that determine the layout, colors, text styles, structure, graphics, images, and use of interactive features that deliver pages to your site visitors. Web Design is a crucial component in web development, and students who learn design will be able to engineer positive and interactive user experiences through innovative interfaces.</p>

              <h3>PHP &amp; Drupal</h3>
              <p>PHP is a popular programming language used for web development, especially for content-heavy websites. It's most commonly used with content management systems like WordPress, Drupal, and Joomla, but is also used in many web applications and backends as well. Students who learn to code in PHP will be able to collect form data, generate dynamic page content, send and receive cookies, and much more.</p>
              <p>Drupal is content management software (CMS) that is used to create and manage various types of websites. It allows for easy content authoring, strong security, and consistent performance. Drupal modules extend its functionality, while Drupal themes allow for customization of content presentation. Students who learn Drupal will be able to build structured and organized sites quickly and efficiently.</p>

              <h3>Ruby &amp; Rails</h3>
              <p>Ruby is a programming language focused on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write. The Ruby programming language is most commonly used with the Ruby on Rails framework. Ruby and Rails are typically used by younger companies and startups, especially for building interactive web applications.</p>
              <p>Rails is a web development framework written in the Ruby language and typically referred to as “Ruby on Rails”. Rails was the first mainstream web framework to embrace the concept of convention over configuration, which improves productivity by setting sensible defaults that work for most projects.</p>
